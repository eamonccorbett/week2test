Intro to Git

Repositories
    kind of like a folder
    basic unit that we edit in Git
    don't have nested respositories

"Commit"
    like save
    you commit a repository

Commands
    All of our commands call the git program
    So they start with "git"
    to create a new repository the command is git init
    git status
    git log

Commits
    two stage process
        working directory to staging area (via git add)
        then to respository using git commit

Cloning
    most commonly github to local
    taking something that is on github and stick in on your own computer
    need the address of the repository
    git clone (repository address)

Push and pull
    if you make changes on your local copy, you can push those commits to the github version
    if there are changes to the github version, you can pull those changes to your local version

Forking
    very similar to Cloning
    rather than copying it onto your computer, you are making a copy that you now own on your own github
